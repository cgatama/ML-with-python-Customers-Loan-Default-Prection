# Machine Learning Classification Problem with Python
## Predicting if Customers will Default on Loans

Using different machine learning classification Algorithms to find the best (among Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Linear Regression) to accurately predict if a customer would default on their loan or if it would be paid off by Model evaluation using test set (by report the accuracy of the built model using different evaluation metrics such as Jaccard score,	F1-score	and LogLoss).
